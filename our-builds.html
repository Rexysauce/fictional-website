                        <p>This heavily modified rotary Mazda pushes a whopping
                            675whp,
                            and 435ftâ‹…lb of torque. With two Garrett G-Series
                            G30-900 62mm turbos producing 24 psi.

                        <p>Now a Maxima might not scream performance at first
                            glance,
                            but this 1997 Nissan Maxima has a trick
                            up it's sleeve. Popping the hood reveals a Toytoa
                            2JZ-GTE
                            engine. This engine was crafted in-house
                            and catches many off guard. He prefers to keep the
                            horsepower a secret, but states it exceeds 600whp.

                        <p>Sure, it 'only' makes 400 horsepower. Sure, it's a
                            heavier
                            car due to the symmetrical AWD system.
                            But with in-house chassis reinforcement, and frame
                            rigidity

                            like a dream. Pair that with the advantages of an

                        <p> This popular modular turbo is recommended for race applications only. Due to it's very high
                            compression, and need for a sophisticated oil and cooling system, we recommend spending the extra dime.
                            However once you can feed this monster, it will provide high-RPM performance that is rivaled by almost none. </p>

                        <p> This high lift camshaft paired with a turbo system is perfect for race applications. While the low RPM suffers
                            from torque dip, the powerband this camshaft provides at the high RPM range is consistent and predictable, letting
                            you approach corners with a much more precise speed input. </p>
